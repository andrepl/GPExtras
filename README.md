**ATTENTION: This plugin does NOT work with [Grief Prevention](http://github.com/Tux2/GriefPrevention/) by bigscary (and Tux2).  It's an addon for a completely incompatible fork of Grief Prevention.  This, and Grief Prevention TNG Will be undergoing name changes in the near future, sorry for any confusion.**
